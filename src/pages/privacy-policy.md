# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-12-01

Potato Game respects your privacy. This policy explains what information the game collects, how it is used, and your rights as a user. This Privacy Policy is designed to meet App Store requirements and industry‑standard practices.

## Contact

For questions or requests related to privacy, email **privacy@mickschroeder.com**.

## Overview

Potato Game is an iOS game that uses Apple’s CloudKit to support cloud saves and basic gameplay‑related storage. The game does **not** collect personal information for advertising, does **not** use third‑party tracking, and does **not** share your data with external companies.

## Information We Collect

### 1. CloudKit Data
Potato Game uses Apple CloudKit to store:
- Game progress (levels completed, settings, achievements)
- Non-personal gameplay metrics that help ensure the game functions correctly

CloudKit may associate this data with your Apple ID for the sole purpose of syncing your progress across devices. Potato Game does **not** have access to your name, email, or any other Apple ID details.

### 2. Automatically Collected Technical Data
To ensure the game works properly, we may receive:
- Device type (iPhone/iPad model)
- App version
- Operating system version
- Gameplay crash logs

Crash logs are processed through Apple's developer tools and do not contain personally identifiable information.

### 3. No Advertising or Tracking
Potato Game does **not** collect data for advertising.
Potato Game does **not** use any analytics SDKs that track your behavior across other apps or websites.

## How Your Data Is Used

We use the information described above only for:
- Syncing cloud saves
- Debugging crashes or technical issues
- Improving stability and gameplay features

We do not sell, share, or market your information.  
We do not profile users or perform any automated decision‑making.

## Data Storage and Security

All cloud data is stored securely using **Apple CloudKit**, which is governed by Apple’s security and privacy guidelines. Apple encrypts data both in transit and at rest.

Locally stored data (like settings) remains only on your device.

## Children’s Privacy

Potato Game does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has submitted personal information, contact us at **privacy@mickschroeder.com**.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
- Access your data
- Request deletion of your CloudKit data
- Reset or clear local game data

To request data deletion, contact **privacy@mickschroeder.com** and include your iCloud email so we can identify the CloudKit record.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we change how we handle data, we will update this Privacy Policy. Continued use of Potato Game after changes means you accept the updated policy.
